Non-profits apply for a lot of grants, most of which require at least some basic reporting of the efficacy of the grant. Additionally, many non-profits receive a lot of grants, whose reporting requirements are often very different. This app functions, in many ways, like a time-sensitive to-do list, but with some extra magic. Here is the user story:

1. I am a grantwriter for a non-profit that just received a grant. I fire up the tracker, create a new grant record, and input relevant contact information for the granting organization, as well as the details of the grant (amount, description, etc).
2. While doing so, I upload relevant documents from the granting organization; these are now stored in a central location. I can make this grant visible to others in my organization.
3. I (manually) go through the reporting requirements and create to-do items for each of them (e.g. "Collect program metrics"), each with a due-date and a person to whom they’re assigned.
4. Completion of a to-do item often (but not always) involves uploading a file and/or typing up a summary.
5. The tracker emails me whenever a task gets completed AND it emails me whenever a deadline is approaching.
6. From the admin panel, I can view all grants that are active, all upcoming tasks (sorted by deadline and tagged by grant), and recently completed tasks (ditto).

This tool’s primary use is organizing and collecting the information used to write grant reports.

Here is a [sample template for a grant report](http://www.knightfoundation.org/knight-news-challenge/sample-grant-agreement/). Every bold-faced heading constitutes a section of the report. The grant-tracker application should not compile the reports, per se, but instead should be a thing that can be used to keep track of the documents and materials.
